### This modpack comes with the bare essentials.
This modpack comes with very little so then it is easy to mod your game with zero to no mod incompatibilites, if you want a preconfigured modpack, use [Overly Added](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ovad) for your Vanilla server needs.

### Ram limited?
This pack is almost guaranteed to run at minimum of around 512MB of ram.

### Issues with vanilla?
Below is an image from vanilla to OVOP.
